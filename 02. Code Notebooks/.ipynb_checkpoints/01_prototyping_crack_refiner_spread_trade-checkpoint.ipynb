    "This notebook implements a quantitative trading strategy using futures data and refiner stock prices. It fetches historical futures and stock prices, constructs a crack spread, and calculates the spread between the crack spread and refiner stock price. The strategy then computes a rolling z-score to generate trading signals based on standard deviation thresholds. Finally, it evaluates the performance of the strategy using Pyfolio for comprehensive performance analysis."

    "# Introduction to the Trade\n",
    "The [crack spread](https://www.cmegroup.com/education/articles-and-reports/introduction-to-crack-spreads.html) is a trading strategy in the energy sector that captures the price differential between crude oil and its refined products, most commonly gasoline and heating oil.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 3:2:1 crack spread calculation starts with the spot price for two barrels of gasoline, added to the spot price for one barrel of heating oil, and then subtracts the spot price for three barrels of WTI crude oil.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the spot month RBOB gasoline per-gallon price multiplied by 42 and the spot month NY heating oil per-gallon price multiplied by 42 to reach a price per barrel. WTI crude is already quoted in dollars per barrel. The resulting value is then divided by three to scale the calculation to per-crude-barrel price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dive in.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Trading Crack Spread Against a Refiner Stock\n",
    "\n",
    "When trading the crack spread against a refiner stock, you are comparing the profitability of refining operations to the market's valuation of a specific refining company.\n",
    "\n",
    "Refiner stocks should theoretically benefit from a widening crack spread, as their margins improve when the price difference between crude and its products increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Economic Rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "The economic rationale behind the correlation between the crack spread and refiner stocks is straightforward:\n",
    "\n",
    "Refiners purchase crude oil and sell its refined products.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the spread between the two widens, the refiner's profit margin inherently expands. Consequently, refiner stocks should move in tandem with crack spreads as the market prices in the information. This doesn’t always happen; factors such as operational efficiency, regulatory changes, and broader market sentiment can cause divergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "That divergence is our opportunity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Trade Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose the crack spread widens substantially, but a refiner's stock hasn't reacted. In that case, you buy the refiner stock in anticipation of its price increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first calculate the crack spread as described above. Then, we create the spread, which measures the difference between this crack spread and the refiner’s price.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rolling z-score of this spread is calculated over our window, which normalizes the spread by its rolling mean and standard deviation. This is what we’ll use as a signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our strategy takes a long position in the refiner if the z-score crosses below -2.0 and closes the position if it crosses above 2.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to do just enough to determine whether the strategy is worth pursuing.\n",
    "\n",
    "No commissions, no slippage, nothing fancy."

    "[Pyfolio Reloaded](https://github.com/stefan-jansen/pyfolio-reloaded) is a Python library designed for evaluating the performance of trading strategies and investment portfolios.\n",
    "\n",
    "It provides a full suite of risk and return analytics, including Sharpe ratio, drawdowns, and exposure analysis. The library generates professional-quality tear sheets that combine charts and metrics into a standardized report. It integrates easily with pandas time series and supports both backtested and live trading results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pyfolio Reloaded is widely used because it gives traders and quants a fast, consistent way to validate strategies and communicate results.  "

    "Running a tear sheet is essential in algorithmic trading because it transforms raw strategy returns into actionable insights. It provides standardized diagnostics—such as Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, and exposure—that allow you to evaluate robustness. This step is the bridge between coding a strategy and assessing whether it is viable for live trading.  "
